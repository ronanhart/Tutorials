We want to name it rgee since we will use this environment to work with the rgee package. In the command prompt, enter conda create --name rgee and enter y when prompted. Activate your conda rgee environment by entering conda activate rgee You should now see (rgee) in front of your user name Note: to exit the rgee environment, enter conda deactivate and you should see (base) in front of your user name again. Install the Earth Engine API into this conda rgee environment by entering conda install -c conda-forge earthengine-api==0.1.323 and type y when prompted. conda install is the method of installing any packages into the conda environment. -c conda-forge is needed because earthengine-api is not a built-in package in python (kind of like how you might install a github package using devtools::). Note that we are installing version 0.1.323 of earthengine-api. This is not the most recent version of earthengine-api, but rgee was developped and will work best with this version. Go ahead and also install the package pandas (a python package that handles data management, similar to dplyr in R). Enter conda install pandas and type y when prompted. This will automatically install all of pandas dependencies, like numpy (a package that handles scientific computation) 2.1.1 Install gcloud We need to ensure that gcloud is installed to connect our Google credentials to Earth Engine API Check that gcloud is installed or not by typing in the command shell glcoud --help if the result is something like 'gcloud' not found or 'gcloud' not recognized as a command, then gcloud is not installed. (If you see something besides the above, then skip to the rest of this section) Install the gcloud Command Line Interface (CLI) by following the instructions here After the installer finishes, select the option to open the Google Cloud Command Prompt. If you closed out of the installer without selecting to open the Google Cloud Command Prompt, it’s ok. Close and re-open the Windows Command Prompt and type cd &quot;AppData\\Local\\Google\\Cloud SDK&quot; You are now in this folder directory. Now type cloud_env.bat And now you are in the Google Cloud CLI You will be prompted to log in. Type y and a browser window will automatically open. Log in to the Google account that your Earth Engine account is connected to. Return to the command prompt and select the correct cloud project that you are working in. Close and re-open the Command Prompt shell, re-activate conda and the conda rgee environment (you should see (rgee) in front of your user name) 2.2 Connect your Earth Engine credentials to the API In the command shell, type earthengine authenticate A browser will automatically open. Log in to the Google account connected to your Earth Engine account and allow access to the API 2.2.0.1 Check that the API was connected correctly In the command shell, type python This will begin a python interpreter in your conda ee environment, allowing you to code in python in the command shell Type import ee ee.Initialize() print(ee.Image(&#39;USGS/SRTMGL1_003&#39;).getInfo()) If the command line prints out metadata of a DEM dataset (looking something like {'type': 'Image', 'bands': …), then you have successfully conencted the API to your Earth Engine account To exit the python interpreter, type ctr + Z (It will look like ^Z) 2.3 R Markdown This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com. When you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: summary(cars) 2.4 Including Plots You can also embed plots, for example: Note that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
